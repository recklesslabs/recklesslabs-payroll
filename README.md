# Solidity Payroll Contract

A very simple Payroll contract written in solidity. I think it is a good starting point to bootstrap your own payroll contract.

Extra features that can be added in the future:

- Oracle for ETH payments
- Relayer support
- Nice-to-haves like owner-only payout-all function
